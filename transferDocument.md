# Transfer information

This application is currently being hosted using the [Mijndomein](https://www.mijndomein.nl/) webhosting service, and the database is being hosted using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). If you would like to host the database yourself, run the queries in import.sql to set up the tables. Do note that a new database will not include any user accounts that were stored in the previous database.

If we are still hosting the application online (both the application itself and the database) and you would like us to take it down so you can host it yourself, please contact us at one of these email adresses:
