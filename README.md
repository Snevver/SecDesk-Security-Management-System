# SecDesk Security Management System

This project is a web application developed for SecDesk, aimed at improving the presentation of vulnerabilities found in the infrastructure of the digital environments of clients.

## üìñ Overview

The SecDesk Security Management System provides:

-   A centralized database for storing accounts and penetration test results
-   Different access levels for customers, SecDesk workers (often refered to as "pentesters" in documentation, short for penetration tester), and administrators
-   A detailed overview for each vulnerability per target.
-   Customer comment functionality for vulnerabilities

This web application makes it easy to document affected components, risk statements, recommended fixes, and track the resolution status of identified vulnerabilities.
